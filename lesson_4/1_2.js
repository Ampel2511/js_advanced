let text = "'How old are you?' the man asked. The little boy, at the eternal question, looked at the man suspiciously for a minute and then said, 'Twenty-six. Eight hunnerd and forty eighty.' His mother lifted her head from the book. 'Four,' she said, smiling fondly at the little boy. 'Is that so?' the man said politely to the little boy. 'Twenty-six.' He nodded his head at the mother across the aisle. 'Is that your mother?' The little boy leaned forward to look and then said, 'Yes, that's her.' 'That's your name?' the man asked. The little boy looked suspicious again. 'Mr. Jesus,' he said."
